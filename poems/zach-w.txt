Flame

Rae Armantrout


In the midst of the evident collapse,
I’m bored. What is there left
to say, I say.

I could make a flame
sound like the flick
of a lizard’s tongue,

then like a human
skating
on a pond

of hot wax.

I can’t say
burning oil,

but I can make you think it.
There.

Don’t think of that old canard,
‘Don’t think of an elephant.’

Do you like the word
‘lissome?’TYPO

Shall we fall in love
with the small transparent
dancing girl? Call her

Tinker Bell?
